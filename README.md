# WorkoutApp

This is my first official personal project.
This app is used for the average gym goer and calorie counter who want to track switch to a healthy lifestyle. 

It takes in your daily workout inputs along with details about the workouts and stores them in a viewable list on the workouts screen.

It also tracks a calorie goal set by the user and subtracts calories based on meals eaten over the course of the day.
